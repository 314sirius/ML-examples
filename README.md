# Example2: Image Clustering with K-Means Algorithm
This Python script performs image clustering using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It takes an input image and the desired number of clusters (k) as parameters and returns the clustered image along with the inertia, which is the sum of squared distances of points to their cluster centers. Also it displays a color palette from the unique colors present in a processed image.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
